## Installation

We recommend you install Matlab and Microsoft Excel to access files in the project. 


## Usage

Codes Damkohler_calcs provided can be used to model diffusion/immobilization of a compound. FWHMcalculator can be used to determine full width and half max of plots of interest.


## File Structure

Repositpry contains two folders. FWHM calculator folder contains Matlab script to determine full width at half max of a plot. Protein band spreading model folder contains MAtlab scipt to assess GFP ban spreading and associated Excel files,
